# Nestjs

- \$ npm i -g @nestjs/cli
- \$ nest new nestjs-play
- keeping each module in its own dedicated directory.
- There are two HTTP platforms supported out-of-the-box: express and fastify.

# Controllers

- Controller
  - responsible for handling incoming requests and returning responses to the client.
  - A controller's purpose is to receive specific requests for the application. The routing mechanism controls which controller receives which requests.
  - to create a basic controller, we use classes and decorators.
  - Decorators associate classes with required metadata and enable Nest to create a routing map
- Routing
  - @Controller() decorator, which is required to define a basic controller.
  - defined at Class level, used to group a set of routes
  - \$ nest g controller cats
  - How route is formed/made -> the path includes both the optional controller path prefix + any path string declared in the request method decorator. ex- @Controller('cats') and @Get('profile') thus request url - GET /cats/profile
  - Nest employs 2 different options for manipulating responses:
    - Standard :
      - when a request handler returns a JavaScript object or array, it will automatically be serialized to JSON.
      - When it returns a JavaScript primitive type (e.g., string, number, boolean), however, Nest will send just the value without attempting to serialize it.
      - the response's status code is always 200 by default, except for POST requests which use 201.
      - We can easily change this behavior by adding the @HttpCode(...) decorator at a handler-level
    - Library-specific :
      - We can use the library-specific (e.g., Express) response object
      - Which can be injected using the @Res() decorator in the method handler signature (e.g., findAll(@Res() response))
      - with Express, you can construct responses using code like response.status(200).send()
  - NOTE : we cannot use both approaches at the same time. If both approaches are used at the same time, the Standard approach is automatically disabled.
- Request object :
  - Nest provides access to the request object of the underlying platform (Express by default).
  - We can access the request object by instructing Nest to inject it by adding the @Req() decorator to the handler's signature.
- Resources :
  - Nest provides the rest of the standard HTTP request endpoint decorators - @Put(), @Delete(), @Patch(), @Options(), @Head(), and @All()
- Route wildcards :
  - asterisk is used as a wildcard, and will match any combination of characters.
  - The characters ?, +, \*, and () may be used in a route path, and are subsets of their regular expression counterparts.
  - The hyphen (-) and the dot (.) are interpreted literally by string-based paths.
- Status Code :
  - response status code is always 200 by default
  - except for POST requests which are 201.
  - We can easily change this behavior by adding the @HttpCode(...) decorator at a handler level.
- Headers :
  - @Header() decorator or a library-specific (express) response object (and call res.header() directly)
  - This Response Header, not Request Header
- Redirection :
  - To redirect a response to a specific URL, you can either use a @Redirect() decorator or a library-specific response object (and call res.redirect() directly).
  - requires url argument, and an optional statusCode argument.
  - statusCode defaults to 302 (Found) if omitted.
- Route parameters:
  - Routes with dynamic data can be accessed.
  - Route parameters declared in this way can be accessed using the @Param() decorator, which should be added to the method signature.
- Sub-Domain Routing:
  - A subdomain is a domain that is part of a larger domain
  - For example, west.example.com and east.example.com are subdomains of the example.com domain
  - @Controller decorator can take a host option to require that the HTTP host of the incoming requests matches
  - route path specified in the host can be accessed dynamically using @HostParam() decorator
  - example: \$ nest g controller sub-domain
- Scopes :
  - Node.js doesn't follow the request/response Multi-Threaded Stateless Model in which every request is processed by a separate thread. Hence, using singleton instances is fully safe for our applications.
- Asynchronicity :
  - Every async function has to return a Promise
  - RxJs Observable - Nest will automatically subscribe to the source underneath and take the last emitted value (once the stream is completed).
- Request payloads:
  - for POST route handler to accept client params -use-> @Body()
  - we need to determine the DTO (Data Transfer Object) schema
  - A DTO is an object that defines how the data will be sent over the network.
  - determine the DTO schema by using TypeScript interfaces, or by simple classes.
  - recommend using classes here why ? ==> Classes are part of the JavaScript ES6 standard, and therefore they are preserved as real entities in the compiled JavaScript. On the other hand, since TypeScript interfaces are removed during the transpilation, Nest can't refer to them at runtime.
